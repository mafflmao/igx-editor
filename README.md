# Compatibility
This editor should work with
- Skylanders Spyro's Adventure (WIP, but still functional)
- Skylanders Giants (WIP, but still functional)
- Skylanders SWAP Force (Fully Working)
- Skylanders SWAP Force Alpha (Fully Working)
- Skylanders Trap Team (WIP, but still functional)
- Skylanders Superchargers (Fully Working)
- Skylanders Imaginators (WIP, but still functional)
- Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy (WIP, but still functional)
- Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled (WIP, but still functional)

  If a game is labelled as Fully Working, and it doesn't work, you've most likely done something wrong or entered an invalid value, which isn't my problem!
  If you do think it isn't something you did wrong, message me on discord or complain on GitHub. I can probably try and fix any issues.

  Some igEnums which are present in Superchargers, may not be there in SWAP Force or previous games, so just in case you end up corrupting a file, PLEASE make a backup before using this
